## About the tournament.

We are hosting a tournament with Mr. ****** **** to  provide you some cool prizes. We want to find the true potential in your team and encourage you to be the next generation **SuperBs**.

Our *Checking Algorithm* is satisfying $\aleph(n) = \kappa (n-1) +\forall n\in\mathbb N$ . It is elaborated by:-

$$
\aleph(z) = \int_0^1 x^{n-1}i^{-n} dt\,.
$$


## CAS Sequence

This is the main grading pattern for us:-

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Opponent ->> Dillusioners: Code Comparision takes place
Dillusioners-->>Other Teams: Code Gets Compared with all other teams performed
Dillusioners--x Opponent : Code Comments, Speed and Readability is checked
Dillusioners-x Other Teams: CODE IS SENT FOR COMPARISION WITH TEAMS PERFORMING LATER
Note right of Other Teams: EACH TEAMS PLAYS WITH<br/>ALL OTHER TEAMS<br/>FOR ATLEAST ONCE<br/>IN THE ENTIRE LEAGUE.

Dillusioners-->Opponent : EVENT GETS GRADED
Opponent ->Other Teams: THIS IS SAME FOR ALL ROUNDS
